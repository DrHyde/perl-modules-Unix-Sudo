This perl module will let you run blocks of code as root even if your
program is running as an ordinary user.

Under the bonnet it uses sudo to run those small snippets of code and
comes with ... some caveats.

It's probably most useful for when you want to port a shell script
that uses sudo into a somewhat more capable and maintainable language.
